## Overview
Rocket Booster is an exciting Unity-based game where players navigate a rocket from point A to point B while avoiding various obstacles. The game features four levels, with increasing difficulty. The first two levels provide a simple introduction, while the last two levels present a challenging terrain that is difficult to pass.

## How to Play
- Use **Spacebar** (or assigned thrust key) to propel the rocket upwards.
- Use **Left Arrow** for Left Rotation and **Right Arrow** for Right Rotation to steer the rocket.
- Avoid obstacles to prevent crashing.
- Reach the landing platform to complete the level.
- If the rocket crashes into an obstacle, the level restarts.

## Features
- **Physics-Based Movement:** Realistic rocket propulsion and rotation.
- **Level Progression:** Four levels with increasing difficulty.
- **Obstacle Interaction:** Dynamic obstacles requiring precise navigation.
- **Audio & Particle Effects:** Engine sound and thrust visuals enhance immersion.
- **Debug Keys:** `L` key loads the next level, `C` key toggles collision detection.
